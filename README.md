## Short description

The main goal of this project is to develop an C++ application which is going to store all necessary data for the Car Renal Company. Program will by equipped with a simple user interface allowing the company manager to have a look (and export it to “.CSV” file) on all important statistics to keep hand on plus all the time, menage employees, check cars rental status andwhole needed history.
## Automatic tests

To run the automatic test compiling the program is needed. We can run them by choosing the 5 option in the app menu. The test concluded tests for main classes (add, remove, update) and toggle options. Most of the classes work exactly so I tested only one class of each type.

## Running the code

### For LinuxOS

Navigate to the `lib` folder.
Then use the commands:

```
1. make // To generate compiled output file
2. ./crc // To run compiled code
```

### For WindowsOS

1. Install make for windows [YT-Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taCJhnBXG_w 'Projects Libs')

2. Navigate to the `Source` folder.
   Then use the commands:


```
1. make // To generate compiled output file
2. ./crc.exe // To run compiled code
```
